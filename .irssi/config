# Irssi configuration setup to connect to freenode and use
# xmpp plugin to connect to google talk. You can use
# irc and google talk at the same time, just remember to
# setup the command window to the irc, for example with
#
# /window server freenode
#
# Otherwise regular commands (/nick, /join, etc) will need
# a network prefix, for example:
# 
# /msg -gtalk someone@gmail.com <msg>
# /msg -freenode some_nick <msg>
#
# See http://irssi.org/beginner/#c6
#
# Use /roster to see connected gtalk contacts and just
# regular /msg <address> to msg them
#
# In debian, apt-get install irssi-plugin-xmpp
# 
# For freenode, send the authentication to /nickserv on
# connection
